My model pulls together a few of the Narla descriptions and staples them together with a fake peak to cover the full radial density with just a few parameters.\n",

    "There are four regions: growth, chemotaxis, \"peak\", and diffusion. Narla et al provide a description of the turnover between growth and chemotaxis, which is just a mixture of two exponentials facing different directions. Therefore, is actually quite a bit past the the turnover region. \n",

    "My regions are: growth+chemoaxis, \"peak\", and diffusion. Also, I place left and right cutoffs on the data to avoid any agar stab wounds and the petri dish edge. Also, all of this takes place on top of a floor (i.e., background, b). \n",

There exists a similar $x_{switch,r}$ on the other side.\n",
